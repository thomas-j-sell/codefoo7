## 3 Nuggle (Number Boggle)
This question has it's own [repo](https://github.com/thomas-j-sell/nuggle)

####Can you make a version with a larger grid?
I can, in fact my solution is designed to be flexible enough to solve a puzzle of any size.

####How well does it scale?
The following data is the average time in seconds it takes for my solution on my machine to solve a puzzle (average of 100 puzzles):
* 2x2 average execution time: 0.00015036
* 3x3 average execution time: 0.009666110000000004
* 4x4 average execution time: 21.244139600000008
* 5x5 average execution time: 1008.094548167 (limited to 9 completed runs)

It does not scale well.
